# Portfolio with Project Pages

This variant adds dedicated project pages (under `/projects/`) and Unsplash-style SVG placeholders for thumbnails.

## Deploy
Same as before â€” push to a public GitHub repo and enable GitHub Pages.

## Notes
- Replace `assets/images/*.svg` with your own JPG/PNG images if you'd like.
